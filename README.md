## true[X] Mobile Integration Guide
Integrating True[X] Interactive Ads into your mobile placement

### 1. Overview
There are three major pieces of functionality needed to support True[X] ads:

*	Make an ad request
*	Render interactive ad
*	Handle ad credit (user value exchange)

For many integrations, one or more of these pieces will have already been built and will simply require installation/configuration to set up. Some integrations will require one or more of these pieces be built custom by your app/dev team.
